Hello and welcome. My name is Wenxiao Cai and I am an undergraduate student in Southeast University based in Nanjing, China. I will graduate in June 2024, with GPA ranking 1st in the School of Automation.

<br><br>
My research interest lies in algorithms and applications in deep learning and computer vision. I am particularly interested in semantic segmentation, image stitching, depth estimation, uncertainty estimation and 3D reconstruction. I'm a reviewer for NeurIPS, ICLR and ICML.
